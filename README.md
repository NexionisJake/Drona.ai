# Anti-Copilot 🚫🤖

**Kill the Vibe. Build the Code.**

> "I fear the day that technology will surpass our human interaction. The world will have a generation of idiots." — Albert Einstein (apocryphal, but relevant)

Anti-Copilot is a **Socratic Code Editor** designed to prevent "Vibe Coding" — the habit of blindly pasting AI-generated code without understanding it. 

When you paste a large block of code (e.g., >25 lines), the editor **LOCKS**. To unlock it, you must answer Socratic questions generated by an AI Mentor about the code you just pasted. Prove you understand it, or delete it and write it yourself.

## 🚀 Features

- **Paste Trap**: Detects large pastes and instantly locks the editor.
- **Socratic Mentor**: Uses **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** to generate context-aware questions about the pasted code's logic, security, and performance.
- **Builder Score**: Gamified scoring system that rewards manual typing (+0.2/burst) and penalizes pasting (-0.2/line).
- **Escape Hatch**: Press `Ctrl+Z` to "Reject the Vibe", undo the paste, and refund your score penalty.
- **Vibe UI**: A "GitHub Dark" aesthetic with glassmorphism, animations, and a dedicated Mentor Sidebar.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Monaco Editor.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11), Uvicorn, Anthropic API (Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
- **Communication**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming AI responses.

## 📦 Setup & Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.11+
- An Anthropic API Key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repo**
2.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    ```
3.  **Run the Full Stack**:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```
    This script sets up the Python virtual environment, installs dependencies, and launches both frontend (`localhost:5173`) and backend (`localhost:8000`).

## 🧪 Demo Flow

1.  Open `http://localhost:5173`.
2.  Type some code manually to see your **Builder Score** go green.
3.  Paste the snippet from `structure/demo_paste_snippet.py`.
4.  Watch the editor **LOCK**.
5.  Answer the Mentor's questions in the sidebar.
6.  **PASS** the quiz to unlock the editor.
7.  **FAIL** or get stuck? Press `Ctrl+Z` to undo and try again.
